Welcome to Tigerlings!

[TigerBeetle](https://tigerbeetle.com) is the financial transactions database built for unparalleled performance and mission-critical safety.

This project is an interactive tutorial that teaches you how to use TigerBeetle by fixing small scripts.
Each script has some small error that you'll need to correct -- but don't worry, we'll explain everything you need to know!

This project was directly inspired by the [Ziglings](https://ziglings.org) and [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) projects.

## Getting Started

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerlings.git
cd tigerlings
./run.sh
```

The [run.sh](./run.sh) script runs each exercise, one at a time, and stops at the first broken one.

You can get started with exercise [000_download.sh](./exercises/000_download.sh), which, as you might guess, helps you download TigerBeetle.

Once you've fixed the download script, run [run.sh](./run.sh) again to have it go to the next exercise.

Happy learning!
